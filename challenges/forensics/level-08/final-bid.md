Hello from Athens,
Our work here is almost complete. The antique dealers we have been working with have been instrumental in helping us to hack into the digital auction system. Without them we would be stuck at the script kiddie level! 
I suspect we will have all we need very soon, you know what you need to do, so just keep doing it. This time next year we will be millionaires.
