# Photo Rapide
It looks like the photographer took a particular interest in what the employees of the business were doing whilst he was in their shop. We think he actually saw one of them enter the password to one of their internal systems and then hid it, in plain sight, in a photo he took. Our team gained access to the photo files he didn't share with the business. Can you look closely to see if he's using them to hide the passwords?

**Tip:** Find the password he stole, it's the flag.
