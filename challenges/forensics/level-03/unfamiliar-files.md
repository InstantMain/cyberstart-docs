# Unfamiliar Files
Here's a strange one for you, agent. Our team was able to recover a hard drive owned by one of the hackers and found all kinds of interesting things on it. Unfortunately, some of the files don't seem to work and we're not sure what they are. Can you take a look at this one and see if you can figure it out.

**Tip:** Open the file to get the flag.
