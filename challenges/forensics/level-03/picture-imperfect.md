# Picture Imperfect
The team in New York have been reviewing some of the design work created by the suspects and some of the pieces look really strange. We're sure they must contain a secret of some kind. Have a look at this one for example on his "About Page" site, can you see anything that doesn't look right?

**Tip:** There's a secret in the image, that's the flag.

## Steps
1. Import the image into an image steganography tool
1. Put the image through the color filters until the flag is visible
