# Peculiar Portfolio
One of the graphic designers also works as a photographer and usually posts his images on his personal portfolio. But our team noticed he created a second portfolio with just one image on it, which we thought was strange. It made us think maybe it contained a secret message of some kind. Take a look and see what you think.

**Tip:** The image contains a secret, that's the flag.
