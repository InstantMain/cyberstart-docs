# Cold File
Agent, quick task for you if you have a few minutes to spare. We have an old program one of our previous agents used that we can't get into. Can you get into it for me?

**Tip:** Run the program, find the password, input it into the program to get the flag.

## Files
[program-x86](/assets/files/program-x86_2)

1. Execute the program in a Linux system and input the password
    - May need to run *chmod +x* on the program to enable executable privileges
